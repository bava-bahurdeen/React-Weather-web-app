Welcome to the React Weather App repository! This is a simple web application built with React that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a location.

## Features

- Fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays the current temperature, weather description, and location.
- Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
- Provides a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Demo

You can access a live demo of the React Weather App here: [Weather App Demo](https://your-demo-link.com)
